# resumeGenerator.github.io

This my Resume Generator project, in which user has to enter his/her various personal and professional details in a given form some which are mandatory (marked by '*'). After the user fills all the details and clicks on 'Generate CV' button a resume template, containing all these details, is generated. User can also print this resume using 'PrintCV' button. In this project, I have used a variety of front-end web development technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap framework.
